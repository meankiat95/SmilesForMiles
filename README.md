Steps to follow for ReadME file
***************************
a README.md file that contains
the usual “Introduction” section from your previous documents
your final “Component Diagram” section that shows us the complete high-level picture of how your code is structured. Please include any frameworks your code builds upon as well as servers (database, etc) that you interact with. There is no need to re-submit any corresponding class diagrams.
a “How to run” section that tells the user how to “run” this prototype, including any special methods to interact with it
a “Video” youtube url to a short video showcase of your prototype app

## Appendix

### Installation Guide
This portion of the readme would explain the various requirements needed to setup the server & android application for testing the SmilesforMiles application

### 1) Setting up a web server

Requirements for web server
  * VirtualBox/VMWare Workstation
  * 2GB RAM
  * 10 GB Storage Space
  * 2 Cores

  Download the .ova file of the pre-exported webserver from this link: [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p9gm9_exVeCiIgwtNIiAB_qnpEsXqFXJ)

### 2) This would include a preconfigured XAMPP and Apache webserver with HTTPS 

  **Why is this needed?**

  To prevent Man-In-The-Middle(MITM) attacks, a secured web server is configured to prevent hackers from being able to modify the GET/POST request between the application and the server to prevent unauthorized use and illegal actions within the application.
