### Installation Guide
This portion of the readme would explain the various requirements needed to setup the server & android application for testing the SmilesforMiles application

### 1) Setting up a web server

Requirements for web server
  * VirtualBox/VMWare Workstation
  * 2GB RAM
  * 10 GB Storage Space
  * 2 Cores

  Download the .ova file of the pre-exported webserver from this link: [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1p9gm9_exVeCiIgwtNIiAB_qnpEsXqFXJ)

### 2) This would include a preconfigured XAMPP and Apache webserver with HTTPS 

  **Why is this needed?**

  To prevent Man-In-The-Middle(MITM) attacks, a secured web server is configured to prevent hackers from being able to modify the GET/POST request between the application and the server to prevent unauthorized use and illegal actions within the application.
